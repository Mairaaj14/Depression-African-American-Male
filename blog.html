            Depression is one of the most common mental disorders that we might
            all get to
            experience through out our lifetime. One of the main symptoms of
            this mental disease
            is pretty much disconnecting from the real world slowly. Not being
            interested in anything around us
            anymore, feeling like you are in a black hole literally, nothing
            matters anymore.
            This is a feeling that is definitely scary to experience,
            and it is proven by facts that African American men are more
            likely to suffer from this than any other race. It was of my interest to
            deep more into the factors of why this is happening.
            I currently live in a neighborhood where most of my neighbors are
            African Americans.
            I wanted to dig deep into the facts and find out why they are
            one of the most affected communities.
            There's many contributors that lead to depression, the one that most
            stood out
            to me were how minorities, in this case African Americans are
            treated just because of their background.

             Discrimination and stereotypes takes a big role into leading a person to depression.
            "...there is
           
            a growing body of evidence demosntrating the role of factors
            such as socioeconomic status, social stressors(including
            discrimination),
            
            and psychological coping resources for depressive symptoms among
          
            African American men." says Dr.Mathew D. Gayman. 
            Dr. Gayman and collegues from Georgia State University conducted a
            community based sample to identify the risk and protective
            factors for mental health among adult black men. Other factors such as
            family support, mastery, self-esteem, chronic stressors, and the
            biggest one - discrimination were found to be 
            independently associated with depression.
           
            African Americans are more likely to be victims of police brutality
            and racial discrimination than any other race. 
            
         
            Slavery is also a factor that has an affect in African American's
            mental health. Growing up for most was hard also because of the
            macroeconomics that surrounded them.
           
            Many live in a low income meighborhood surrounded by drugs, gang
            members
         
            and other cycles that make it harder for them to get out of the low
            income cycle.
            This leads to poor health and poor life decisions that also lead to
            depression. Although depression is one of the most common mental
            disorders, the lack of resources is a big one in the African
            American community.

            <br>
            According to a video by Dr.Harold, a professor from Michigan State
            University, black men are the less likely to seek help when they are
            experiencing depression. It is interesting and reveling to find out
            exaclty why they don't seek help.
            Maybe the stigma of growing up without needing to ask for help is a
            big contributor. Many minorities are not offered the resources and help other groups might get and
            this leads to something that is not acceptable or known as "normal".
            Not making these resources accessible is something that needs to
            change in low income communitites. I believe mental health should be taught
            early in schools, because it contributes at how we see the world
            around us and also helps us take control of our feelings.
            I also believe mental health awareness should be normalized and
            practiced with younger generations. So they learn to seek help when
            needed, and be able to distinguish bad emotions and cope with them.
